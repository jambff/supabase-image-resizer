# Jambff Supabase Image Resizer

An image resize service backed by Supabase.

## Manual setup

Install the package:

```text
yarn install @jambff/supabase-image-resizer
```

Via a `.env` file, or some other mechanism depending on your environment, set
the `SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL` and `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` as environment
variables, which can be retrieved from the Supabase dashboard.

Launch the server with:

```js
import { launchServer } from '@jambff/supabase-image-resizer';

launchServer();
```

## Usage

Image requests are made in the following format:

```text
http://your.domain.com/<BUCKET>/<FOLDER>/<FILE_NAME>
```

for example:

```text
http://your.domain.com/images/public/my-image.jpg
```

The following query parameters are available:

| URL Arg | Type | Description |
|---|----|---|
|`w`|Number|Max width of the image.|
|`h`|Number|Max height of the image.|
|`quality`|Number, 0-100|Image quality.|
|`resize`|String, "w,h"|A comma separated string of the target width and height in pixels. Crops the image.|
|`crop_strategy`|String, "smart", "entropy", "attention"|There are 3 automatic cropping strategies for use with `resize`: <ul><li>`attention`: good results, ~70% slower</li><li>`entropy`: mediocre results, ~30% slower</li><li>`smart`: best results, ~50% slower</li>|
|`gravity`|String|Alternative to `crop_strategy`. Crops are made from the center of the image by default, passing one of "north", "northeast", "east", "southeast", "south", "southwest", "west", "northwest" or "center" will crop from that edge.|
|`fit`|String, "w,h"|A comma separated string of the target maximum width and height. Does not crop the image.|
|`crop`|Boolean\|String, "x,y,w,h"|Crop an image by percentages x-offset, y-offset, width and height (x,y,w,h). Percentages are used so that you donâ€™t need to recalculate the cropping when transforming the image in other ways such as resizing it. You can crop by pixel values too by appending `px` to the values. `crop=160px,160px,788px,788px` takes a 788 by 788 pixel square starting at 160 by 160.|
|`zoom`|Number|Zooms the image by the specified amount for high DPI displays. `zoom=2` produces an image twice the size specified in `w`, `h`, `fit` or `resize`. The quality is automatically reduced to keep file sizes roughly equivalent to the non-zoomed image unless the `quality` argument is passed.|
|`webp`|Boolean, 1|Force WebP format.|
|`lb`|String, "w,h"|Add letterboxing effect to images, by scaling them to width, height while maintaining the aspect ratio and filling the rest with black or `background`.|
|`background`|String|Add background color via name (red) or hex value (%23ff0000). Don't forget to escape # as `%23`.|
